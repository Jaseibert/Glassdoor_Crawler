# Glassdoor Crawler

**Author:** [Jeremy Seibert](https://www.jeremyseibert.com)<br/>

[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com) is a great company that gives job candidates, and recruiters a place to find and post open job positions.  Beyond this Glassdoor provides two other awesome functionalities. The first is that it offers job candidates the opportunity to anonymously post descriptions, and questions from interviews that they have had. The second is that current employees can post their salary data anonymously, so job candidates and potentially others within the organization can better negotiate compensation.

## Functionality

This repository contains two modules which help to accomplish three primary tasks for job candidates. Those three primary uses of this package are:

1. To aggregate key pieces of information about a job listing on available Glassdoor.

2. To analyze and locate the most promising positions.

3. To help identify the keywords/phrases within job postings, which if put in your resume may help to boost your rating in an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).

#Status

Currently (07/28/2019), this repository has 2 primary python modules (glassdoor_crawler.py and glassdoor_scraper.py). I am in active development on both of them so there may be reduced functionality.

# Wrap-up

Again this is currently under development so there may be reduced functionality, but I hope this helps people looking to simplify the job searching process!
